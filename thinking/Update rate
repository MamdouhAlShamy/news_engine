To achieve update rate:

- Request to update news from server
- Server internally parse news (not important now) <<
	- related takes allot of time, so I need to stop the deapth of related news

IDEA:
Client will ask for HIS<ClientId> - as server will store for each user last update - and will send him the remaining news

STEPS:
- News time should be correct in db so update is meaningful
wut made the time of data in db not saved cor rectly ?? << DONE
- create account << DONE
- make this account login << DONE
- create a new colum(news_last_update) in Users Table with last time of update << DONE
	- it is filled while registration w the time of registeration
- when user request an update, I will check the his last update
and send HIM only the last news newer than his last update << DONE
- set User new LastUpdate with current time ><


Problem w story parser, err w mass assignment, solved w story model
For id 1-4 of category time saved correctly
problem w elwatan as it save the time -2 (like GMT)
I want to correct el watan time FAKES

I want the system automaticlly
 - to avoid related topics now
 
I want to make when the user register, LastUpdateTIme to yesterday << DONE

Wut is needed after 90% of the implementation:
- Set user set User new LastUpdate with current time<< DONE but w a bug in password saving in SQLite (TAKE CARE)
- make auto INTERNAL parser to feed the beast
